Running the python file for Question No. 1 :

1. Run the python file named Question_1.py
2. It will ask for some iso value input, give any input.
3. The range should be between (-1434.8590087890625, 630.5694580078125), as the pressure value lies      into this region only.
4. If given iso value is out of range then it won't be getting any point and the generated vtp image will be blank.



Running the vtp file named isocontour_2D.vtp :

1. The python file will create a vtp file named isocontour_2D.vtp in the same directory.
2. Just open the isocontour_2D.vtp in paraview, it will show the contour line in white colour.
3. The white line is the line of values given by user.



Running the python file for Question No. 2 :

1. Run the python file named Question_2.py
2. It will ask for "do you want to use the Phong Shading or not"
3. If you want the Phong shading then type "yes"
4. If you do not want the Phong Shading then you can type anything other than "yes"
5. It will then create a renderer window where you can see the output of the Question 2
6. Just put the python_space in background and check the renderer window output
